function creation

Function obj

--code -- src flags with n without url
the only difference is in the package obj there's a functionName key

package obj

--code with n without url
Difference : inside spec-> deployment
            with url : url key (the url of the code)
            without url: literal (encoded code)

--src with n without url
haven't tested

--src --code without url
    --code spec-> deployment has literal, type | source doesnt
    -- src spec -> source has literal, type | deployment  doesnt
    in --src there's an additional buildCmd
